# Current_temp
This is a program was created to practice web scraping using Beautiful Soup.

The program prompts the user for a zip code, checks that the input follows the right format. It then uses the zip code
to scrape the latitude, longtitude, city, and state matching the zip code. All of this data is scraped from melissadata.com. 
With the lat and long the current temperature is scraped from weather.gov. The city and state is just used for printing a 
message to the user. There is also some string formatting to put the city and state in a framiliar format. To web scrape 
Beautiful Soup was used, the program was written in Python.
